jFitbit](https://github.com/claygregory/jfitbit) library 
+ ProcessingData, library to make Processing 2.0 Data functions available in Processing 1.5.1
+ ULastFM_Simple, parses and display Last.fm CSV data
+ PinterestScrape, old scraper code written for a previous Pinterest design [LIKELY BROKEN]
+ Processing Serial hack, attempt to force the Serial library to deal with dropped connections etc. It never solved my problem, anyway. [LIKELY BROKEN]
