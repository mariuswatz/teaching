## ProcessingData - Processing 2.0 Data API adapted for Processing 1.5.1

This is a quick hack to make the Data API introduced in Processing 2.0 available while using Processing 1.5.1. 

Functions like loadTable() and saveTable() that are native to PApplet in 2.0 are provided through a helper class called unlekker.data.ProcessingData. See the included LoadSaveTable example for a demo.

Code ported from (Processing 2.0 core)[https://github.com/processing/processing/] and adapted to be compatible with Processing 1.5.1. 

Disclaimer: This library has not been extensively tested. Please report bugs and issues at
